# Week 10 — Scaling

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gnoejh/soc4180/blob/main/weeks/w10-scaling/lab.ipynb)

| --- | --- |
| **Runtime** | **GPU required** — the final section needs CUDA, not just rendering. |
| **Wall clock** | ~2 min for the measured sections; Track A adds ~15 min on GPU. |
| **Needs** | `soc4180[rl]` for the CPU work; `playground` for the GPU section. |
| **Platform** | The GPU section **cannot run on Windows** — JAX ships CUDA wheels for Linux only. |

## Objectives

1. Quantify the gap between our training budget and a real one.
2. Distinguish *vectorised* from *parallel*, and measure the difference.
3. Explain what `jit` and `vmap` buy, and what they cost in code style.
4. Read the tuned playground configuration and justify its choices.
5. Diagnose a learning curve from its shape.

## Measured results (local, 36-core Windows machine)

| Setup | Throughput |
| --- | --- |
| single environment | **1308 control steps/s** (13,083 physics steps/s) |
| `DummyVecEnv`, 1 / 4 / 16 envs | 1173 / 1240 / 1250 — **no gain** |
| `SubprocVecEnv`, 2 / 4 / 8 envs | 1649 / 3205 / 5570 — scales with cores |

**150M steps at the single-env rate is ~32 hours.** `DummyVecEnv` batches the
policy forward pass, which was never the bottleneck — the physics still runs one
environment at a time. "Vectorised" does not mean "parallel".

`SubprocVecEnv` genuinely parallelises but is capped by core count, and **a Colab
CPU runtime has two**. The tuned config asks for 8192 environments.

## Verified from the library

Read from `mujoco_playground`, not quoted from memory:

- `BerkeleyHumanoidJoystickFlatTerrain`: **150,000,000** timesteps, **8192**
  parallel envs, batch 256, discount 0.97
- `Op3Joystick`: 100,000,000 timesteps, 8192 envs
- Network: policy `(512, 256, 128)` reading `state`; value `(512, 256, 128)`
  reading **`privileged_state`**

That last line is the **asymmetric actor-critic** from Week 6, in production: the
critic sees what no real robot can measure, and is discarded after training.

Our entire Week 9 experiment was **0.027%** of one tuned run.

## Not verified

**The GPU training cell is `eval: false` and has not been run by the instructor.**
JAX's CUDA wheels are Linux-only, so it cannot be tested on the authoring
machine. `playground` *imports* fine here on CPU-only JAX — the registry and
configs above are genuinely read — but the training path is untested.

Before teaching this week, run Track A once on a Colab T4 and record the actual
wall-clock, then set `num_timesteps` so it lands at 12–15 minutes.
